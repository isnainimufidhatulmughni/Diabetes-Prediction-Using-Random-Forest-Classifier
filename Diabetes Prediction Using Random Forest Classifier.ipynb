In this case, an example of hyperparameter would be the number of neighbors. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Best Hyperparameters: {'max_depth': None, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 5, 'n_estimators': 50}\n","[[11  2]\n"," [ 1 10]]\n","              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       0.92      0.85      0.88        13\n","           1       0.83      0.91      0.87        11\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.88        24\n","   macro avg       0.88      0.88      0.87        24\n","weighted avg       0.88      0.88      0.88        24\n","\n"]}],"source":["# Hasil hyperparameter terbaik\n","print(\"Best Hyperparameters:\", grid_search.best_params_)\n","\n","# Prediksi dengan model terbaik\n","best_rf = grid_search.best_estimator_\n","y_pred_simple = best_rf.predict(X_test_simple)\n","\n","# Evaluasi performa model\n","print(confusion_matrix(y_test_simple, y_pred_simple))\n","print(classification_report(y_test_simple, y_pred_simple))\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":34,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Akurasi: 87.50%\n"]}],"source":["best_rf.fit(X_train_simple, y_train_simple)\n","\n"," # Memprediksi data uji\n","y_pred_simple = best_rf.predict(X_test_simple)\n","\n"," # Menghitung akurasi\n","accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test_simple, y_pred_simple)\n","print(f\"Akurasi: {accuracy:.2%}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f8d10255-2782-4f5b-b2c3-76e16d41a2f6","metadata":{},"source":["This time, the accuracy is 87.50%, which is good considering that you are fitting on only the Glucose column instead of the all of the columns.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Uji coba pada data baru"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":40,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["0    Diabetes\n","1    Diabetes\n","dtype: object\n"]}],"source":["X_new = pd.DataFrame({\n","    'Glucose': [120, 130]\n","    # Tambahkan fitur lain sesuai dengan yang digunakan saat pelatihan\n","})\n","\n","y_new_pred = best_rf.predict(X_new)\n","y_new_pred = pd.Series(y_new_pred).map({1: 'Diabetes', 0: 'No Diabetes'})\n","\n","# Melihat hasil prediksi\n","print(y_new_pred)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"eb494624-19e8-4dce-8012-2c9b975b608f","metadata":{},"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3c8e3b67-1123-465b-95d3-4012f2474f85","metadata":{},"source":["Copyright © 2020 IBM Corporation.
